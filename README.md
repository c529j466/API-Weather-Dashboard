# API-Weather-Dashboard
A weather dashboard using OpenWeather One Call API

## Description

For this project, I created a weather dashboard that allows users to search for the weather in their city. This dashboard also stores your searched cities on tabs in a sidebar and pulls them from local storage to easily access the weather for your previously searched cities. The project functions in that a user would enter a city into the search bar, the information from that city will appear on cards to the right, and then the city will be stored to the tabs on the left for future searchs. Users are also able to make multiple searches quickly and save multiple searches to the tabs. My motivation for creating the weather dashboard was to better understand JQuery syntax rules and tricks, further my knowledge on bootstrap css, and better my understanding of using local storage on a device to add to functionality of a website.
